# Object-Oriented Programming Concepts in JavaScript

## 1. Class and Objects

**Class:**  
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It encapsulates data for the object and methods to manipulate that data. In JavaScript, classes are defined using the `class` keyword.

**Object:**  
An object is an instance of a class. It holds the data in properties and defines behavior through methods. Each object created from a class shares the same structure but can have its own specific values.

## 2. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data within the same class. This approach restricts access to some of the object's components and helps prevent the accidental modification of data.

## 3. Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a new class, known as a subclass, to inherit properties and methods from an existing class, referred to as a superclass. This allows for code reusability and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.

---

## 4. Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to be used for a general class of actions, with specific behavior determined by the exact nature of the object that is being acted upon.

---

## 5. Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It allows a programmer to work with concepts at a high level without worrying about the underlying implementation.

---

## 6. Static Methods & Properties

Static methods and properties belong to the class itself rather than to any specific instance of the class. They can be accessed directly on the class without creating an instance of it. Static methods are often used for utility or helper functions.

---

## 7. Constructor Function

A constructor function is a special method that is automatically called when an object is instantiated. It initializes the object by setting up its initial state, typically by assigning values to its properties.

---

## 8. Prototype and Inheritance

Prototypes in JavaScript are a mechanism by which objects inherit features from one another. Each object in JavaScript has a prototype, and it is through this prototype that properties and methods can be shared across objects. Prototype-based inheritance allows for the extension of existing objects without the need for creating a new class.

---

## 9. Method Overloading

Method overloading is a concept where multiple methods can have the same name but differ in the type or number of their parameters. It allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, providing different implementations depending on the input.
